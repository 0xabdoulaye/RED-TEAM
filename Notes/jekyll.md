Adding href:
``[![FLipkart](/assets/img/buttons/flipkart.png)](https://www.flipkart.com/){:target="_blank"}``
Works for Jekyll only but in others, it leaves ``{:target="_blank"}`` part as it is.

Was trying to be in the good books of Commonmark as well as kramdown...I think there is a way but can seem to figure out. I do have the markdown docs of github. Could you help me understand?
